              <p class="helvetica-text" style="color: aliceblue;">Hello everyone, my name is Heying Dai, and I go by Daisy. I'm currently a junior at Northeast Forestry University (NEFU), majoring in a field where my passions for microbiology, molecular biology, and synthetic biology converge.
                  I am one of three wet lab leaders for our team, NEFU-CHINA. My primary responsibility is to spearhead the latter two steps of our biosynthetic pathway, focusing on the conversion of p-aminobenzoic acid (p-ABA) to 2-amino-4-acetylphenol (AAP). This role requires not only precision in the lab but also strong leadership to ensure our experiments proceed smoothly and effectively.
                  As a determined Capricorn and an enthusiastic ENFJ, I'm driven to overcome challenges and foster a collaborative spirit within our team. I'm truly excited to be part of the iGEM community and look forward to connecting with and learning from all of you.</p>

As a member of the NEFU-China wet lab team, she actively analyses and resolves numerous issues encountered during the team's experiments. Two consecutive years of work have not diminished her passion for biology; she still pauses to observe nature, feeling a deep-seated love and admiration for the diverse phenomena of life. (She particularly enjoys watching Ruddy Shelduck gliding through the water.)</p>

An experienced overthinker who zeros in on small details others might miss, and a consistent self-critic who uses that edge to tweak work until it feels right.

The unknown always makes people both scared and curious. And I think both of these are the reasons that drive people to explore the truth. The unknown is really maddening. Perhaps it's not that easy to explore a thing thoroughly. The deeper one delves into a matter, the more confusing it becomes. But if one doesn't lose interest in the unknown, perseverance will be the key to opening the door to the truth.</p>
